    "# 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "Machine Learning is the science and art of programming computers so they can learn from data.\n",
    "General definition:Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly                      programmed.\n",
    "# 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "Machine Learning is great for :\n",
    " 1)Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand_tuning or long lists of rules:one Machine Learningalgorithm can \n",
    "  often simplify code and perform better.\n",
    " 2)Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach:The best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n",
    " 3)Fluctuating Environments:a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",
    " 4)Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.\n",
    "# 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training.\n",
    "One such category is supervised Learning,in which the training data we feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called as labels and hence the name labelled training set\n",
    "*Working:\n",
    "The supervised task may be either Regression(to predict a target numerical value) or Classification(to ppredict the class an instance belongs to).\n",
    "The whole dataset is divided into 2 parts:training(80-90 percent of instances) and testing(20 to 10 percent of instances)\n",
    "While training a label is also attached to the features and the model will identify the hidden pattern and whenever the test instances were given to the model it will predict the required possible outcome.\n",
    "# 4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "The two most important tasks that are supervised are Regression and Classification.\n",
    "# 5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "Four common Unsuprvised Tasks are Clustering,Visualization,Dimensionality Reduction and Association Rule Learning.\n",
    "# 6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "The best Machine Learning algorithm to allow a robot to walk in unknown terrain is Reinforcement Learning,where the robot can learn from response of the terrain to optimize itself.\n",
    "# 7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm that arranges unlabeled data points around a specific number of clusters. Machine learning algorithms come in different flavors, each suited for specific types of tasks. Among the algorithms that are convenient for customer segmentation is K-means clustering\n",
    "# 8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "Spam detection is a supervised machine learning problem. This means you must provide your machine learning model with a set of examples of spam and ham messages and let it find the relevant patterns that separate the two different categories.\n",
    "# 9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives. Online learning is great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock prices) and need to adapt to change rapidly or autonomously. Online learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory (this is called out-of-core learning). The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data.\n",
    "# 10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "Out-of-core learning is a method to learn from a huge data that cannot be fit into computer's memory. In this method, the data set is divided into mini batches and uses online learning to learn from them.\n",
    "# 11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "Instance based Learning Algorithm\n",
    "# 12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "Model Parameters: These are the parameters in the model that must be determined using the training data set. These are the fitted parameters.\n",
    " Hyper parameters: These are adjustable parameters that must be tuned in order to obtain a model with optimal performance.\n",
    "# 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function.\n",
    "# 14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "Main challenges of Machine Learning: Bad Algorithm and Bad Data\n",
    "Examples of Bad Data:\n",
    "1)Insufficient quantity of Training Data\n",
    "2)Non Representative Training Data\n",
    "3)Poor Quality Data\n",
    "4)Irrelevant Features\n",
    "Examples of bad Algorithms:\n",
    "1)Overfitting the training Data\n",
    "2)Underfitting the Training data\n",
    "# 15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "In Machine Learning this is called as OverFitting:this means the model performs well on the training data but it does not generalize well.\n",
    "The possible options or solutions:\n",
    "1)To simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters(e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial\n",
    "model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data or by constraining the model\n",
    "2)To gather more training data\n",
    "3)To reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors and remove outliers)\n",
    "# 16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "The only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to actually try it out on new cases. One way to do that is to put your model in production and monitor how well it performs. This works well, but if your model is horribly bad, your\n",
    "users will complain—not the best idea.\n",
    "A better option is to split your data into two sets: the training set and the test set. As these names imply, you train your model using the training set, and you test it using the test set. The error rate on new cases is called the generalization error (or out-of sample error), and by evaluating your model on the test set, you get an estimation of this error. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has never seen before.\n",
    "In short,the test set allows you to compare different models in an unbiased way, by basing your comparisons in data that were not use in any part of your training/hyper parameter selection process.\n",
    "# 17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "Given a choice of hyper parameter values, we use the training set to train the model. But, how do we set the values for the hyper parameters? This is where validation set comes into picture. We  can use it to evaluate the performance of the  model for different combinations of hyper parameter values (e.g. by means of a grid search process) and keep the best trained model.\n",
    "# 18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "Train-dev kit is used when there is a possibility of mismatch in the training data and test, validation data. Train-dev is a part of training data that is held out and used later along with validation data to check the error. If the model predicts well on train-dev batch but not so well on validation data, then there is a data mismatch. If the model is performing well only on training data but not so well on both train-dev and validation data, then the model will be over fitted.\n",
    "# 19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "If we use the test set to tune hyper parameters, you actually give the model a chance to \"see\" the test data and to develop a bias towards this test data. Therefore, you actually lose the possibility to find out how good your model would actually be on unseen data (because it has already seen the test data).\n",
    "In other words we will end up \"fitting\" the model architecture to the testing data - losing the ability to truly evaluate how the model performs on unseen data. This is sometimes referred to as \"Data Leakage\"."
